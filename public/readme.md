Brick Breaker!

press:
d - to enter debug mode, then use ] key to move on a frame by frame basis. Exit debug mode by pressing "d" again. You can restart the browser and the ball will stay at that same point for next game.

n - move to next level
space - restarts the current level

r - restarts the game from level 1

Also, if you hit the ball while the platform is moving fast the ball will gain speed. You can also move the platform back and forth to gain "speed points" which causes the ball to gain speed when it hits the platform.

And ball loses speed for a short while after hitting a brick.

The game will start at last level, it doesn't restart the entire game, even when you reload the browser page
